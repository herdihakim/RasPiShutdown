Python script and schematics for a Raspberry Pi shutdown button.

The original script is authored by AndrewH7 and may be found on Instructables at http://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Raspberry-Pi-Shutdown-Button/?ALLSTEPS

The schematic and information for working with the resistors is from: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/robot/buttons_and_switches/
